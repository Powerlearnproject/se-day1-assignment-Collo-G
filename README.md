#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Software engineering is designing, developing, testing and maintaining software systems.
Software engineering is important in the tech industry as it ensures the development of robust, secure and scalable applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1.The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the growing software crisis.As software systems became more complex, traditional programming methods led to delays, high costs, and unreliable software.

2.The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming 1970s - 1980s.Languages like C++, Smalltalk and later Java were introduced which enabled developers to create modular, maintainable and scalable software.It helped reduce code duplication.

3.The Agile Revolution 2001 - Present.It introduced a flexible and iterative approach to software development prioritizing collaboration, adaptability and customer feedback.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning - It helps the developer to know the budget and timeline of the project. It also helps in assessing feasibility and identify potential risks before development begins.

2.Requirement Analysis - This is aquiring documents both functional and non functional to know what the client needs and to ensure you meet the user expectations.

3.Design - This is by creating sofware architecture, database structures and system models. This ensures that the software meets client needs and expectations.

4.Implementation - This is the phase where the developer writes the code following coding standards, best practices and version control methodologies.

5.Testing - This ensures the software reliability, security and performance before deployment.

6.Deployment - This is where the software is released to the end user.

7. Maintainance and support - The developer provides updates, bug fixes and enhancement based on user feedback ensuring long-term functionality and security of the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Approach
Waterfall: Sequential, linear process; each phase is completed before moving to the next.
Agile: Iterative, flexible approach; development occurs in small, incremental cycles.
2. Flexibility
Waterfall: Rigid; difficult to accommodate changes once development begins.
Agile: Highly adaptable; allows for continuous feedback and modifications.
3. Customer Involvement
Waterfall: Minimal involvement; feedback is collected at the end.
Agile: Continuous involvement; customers provide feedback throughout development.
4. Delivery Time
Waterfall: Full product is delivered at the end of the project.
Agile: Features are delivered in small, functional increments (sprints).
5. Testing
Waterfall: Testing is done after the development phase, leading to late issue detection.
Agile: Testing is ongoing throughout the development cycle.
6. Best for Projects
Waterfall: Suitable for well-defined, stable projects with fixed requirements.
Agile: Ideal for projects with evolving requirements and frequent updates.

-Examples of Use Cases
